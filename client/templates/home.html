Whether it's becoming a full-stack web developer, running a half-marathon, reading more books, writing more often, or becoming a better cook, however, "life" often gets in the way and we end procrastinating on what we would love to achieve.</p>
                    <p>Completing goals is often easier when structure (making a habit out of spending time on your goal) and community support is there to help you out when you get stuck.</p>
